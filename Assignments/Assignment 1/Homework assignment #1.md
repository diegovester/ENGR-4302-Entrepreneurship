Publix is one of the 10 largest-volume supermarket chains in the country with over 1,351 store locations. Even so, they only contains locations in seven states, all of which are in the southest region of the United States.

The first Publix Super Market was created by George Jenkins in 1940. Publix was far from his first experience in working with retail stores. As a child, Jenkins worked in his father's general store. After which he worked for Piggly Wiggly, a large and established grocery store at the time. 

Jenkins worked for Piggly Wiggly for multiple years, but felt his ideas were not being respected. He took it out a small business loan, left his stable job at Piggly Wiggly, and opened a competitor only across the street. 

George Jenkins had always taken an interest in real estate, and followed the Florida Land Boom to take advantage of the growing population. A key factor that allowed Publix to be profitable and survive can be attributed to how well timed this transition occurred. When Jenkins opened the first supermarket in Florida in, Florida's populaion was lower than 1.5 million. By 1990, the population had grown to over 13 million people.

Publix never did go IPO and the only people who can purchase stock in the company are its employees. According to the company's own website, they are the largest employee-owned company in the United States.

Henry Ford always had a fascination with machinery. As a child, he would take things apart and put them back together again. It was this characteristic as well as his persistence that led him to transforming the car industry forever and his commercial success.

Henry Ford may not have invented the car, nor the notion of creating affordable cars, nor the assembly lines used to make them possible. He was, however, the first to create a car affordable enough for the masses that also had a competitive amount of horsepower. Ford achieved this balance through multiple iterations, even multiple companies, before landing on the success of the Model T.
