## HOW TO KNOW WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO INCORPORATE?


## DOES IT REALLY MATTER HOW WE LEGALLY STRUCTURE OUR BUSINESS?
 "double tax" on C corporations
 

## Rules of thumb 

### LLC
Best for self employment
Taxes are low for small revenue
Taxes become too high if revenue becomes too large

### S Corp
It's best to transform an LLC into an S Corp when revenue becomes too large. S Corp offers lower tax rates, but higher complexity.

## Comparison of Entity Types


## A SEPARATE ENTITY FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Resonant Optic Incorporated (ROI)/Resonant Sensors Incorporated (RSI) as IP is very diverse. Most IP resides in ROI.

## Taking formal corporate actions

## WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL RESOLUTIONS
You normally want a double signature system
Government wants timesheets. Who signs the timesheet of the CEO? Principal investigator

## WHAT KIND OF THINGS DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS NEED TO APPROVE?
If you think the company is going to go IPO, you hold onto the stocks.

There is no obligation to ever exercise, if the stock were to lose value.

When you start a company, if you set the shares, you have to set up a stock price. The stock price will be totally arbitrary.

## PIERCING THE CORPORATE VEIL
If you have an LLC, immediately have a separate bank account.
