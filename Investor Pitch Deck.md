# Problem
There are two types of people:  
1. People who want to attend events  
2. People who want to host events  

Unfortunately, at the university level, students on both sides have little time to spare to explore their options.
Students hosting don't have the experience or overhead to be able to advertise effectively.  
Students wanting to attend don't have the time to sift through hundreds of options that don't interest them to find the one that does.
